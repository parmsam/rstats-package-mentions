# rstats-package-mentions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Goal
The goal of rstats-package-mentions is to get package names mentioned in #rstats tweets within the past few days. Try using {targets} to build a pipeline.

## Limitations
Filters for package names following the curly bracket syntax ({dplyr} for example).

## Quick results
What packages were most frequently mentioned in Tweets from the last 7 days?

```{r freq, echo = FALSE}
# tar_read(pkg_mentions) %>% pull(et) %>% .[!is.na(.) & . != ""]
# tar_read(pkg_mentions) %>% slice_max(n, n=10) %>% gt() %>%
#     cols_label(et = "Package", n = "Number of mentions")
tar_read(tweets_plot)
```
